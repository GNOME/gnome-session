.SH NAME
default.session \- GNOME Default session configuration file.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I @datadir@/gnome/default.session
file contains a list of programs to be launched the first time a user
logs into the GNOME environment.
.PP
The format of the file is the one used by the gnome_config libraries,
and it looks like this:
.PP
.nf
[Section]
SEQID,id=uniqueID
SEQID,Priority=PRIO
SEQID,RestartCommand=command
num_clients=TOP
.fi
.PP
There are three possible names for 
.B Section
And they are:
.PP
.I Default
.IP
This specifies the Default session to load
.PP
.I Chooser
.IP
Lets the user configure which non-session aware programs should be
started up when the session begins
.PP
.I Warner
.IP
.PP
Since the gnome_config file format is not very flexible, an array of
data is emulated by listing starting from 0 chunks of
"id,Priority,RestartCommand", and at the end the 
.I num_clients
variable lists the number of chunks listed.
.PP
The 
.B uniqueid
key provides a name that is unique within this file and passed to the
app as the client id which it must use to register with
gnome-session.
.PP
The 
.B RestartCommand
specifies the command to run from the $PATH.
.PP
The 
.B Priority
determines the order in which the commands are started
(with Priority = 0 first) and defaults to 50.
.PP
The clients must be numbered from 0 to the value of 
.I num_clients-1
