	* Makefile.am: don't reference smproxy.man. It
	doesn't exist. Patch from Miguel Ibarra - #104350.

2002-08-11  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* smproxy.c: define NI_MAXHOS if its not
	defined. Fixes #90338. Patch from Ryan
	Lovett.

2002-08-05  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* smproxy.c: revert the previous change. Java's
	session management is even more broken than
	that and the change causes crashes - #89968.

2002-07-10  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* smproxy.c: loosen the constraint vaguely
	specified in the ICCCM, that clients wishing to
	participate in the session indicate so by
	initialising the WM_COMMAND property, to also
	include clients that are participating in the
	WM_SAVE_YOURSELF protocol. #85933.

2002-07-10  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* save.c: (WriteProxyFile): don't use a world
	writeable directory, #87102.

2002-07-02  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Results of Anju's security audit.

	* save.c:
	(unique_filename): use snprintf.
	(WriteProxyFile): use g_get_home_dir ().

	* smproxy.c: use NI_MAXHOST and snprintf.

2002-07-02  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* save.c, smproxy.[ch]: Use XGetWMName instead
	of XFetchName and update for use of XTextProperty.
	Reported by Brian Cameron.

2002-07-02  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* smproxy.c: also set _DT_RESTORE_MODE to "gnome"
	for very broken CDE apps. See #81343.

2002-06-19  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: don't link against all of gnome-libs

2002-05-28  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* smproxy.c (main): remove a duplicated line

2002-05-29  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* smproxy.c (main): set _DT_SAVE_MODE to "gnome" on
	the RootWindow. Workaround for very broken apps that
	don't respect the ICCCM and respond to WM_SAVE_YOURSELF
	unless this is set. See #81343.

2002-02-26  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* Makefile.am: add WARN_CFLAGS.

	* smproxy.c: (ProxySaveYourselfPhase2CB): kill unused var.

	* Makefile.am: cleanups (no other fixes necessary to build with
	gnome 2 - yay)

1999-10-05  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

       * smproxy.c (ConnectClientToSM): Hang SM_CLIENT_ID property on client's
       top-level window.

1999-03-24  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	* smproxy.c (ProxySaveYourselfPhase2CB): Add back the SmDiscardCommand
	accidentally bumped out by adding the SmCloneCommand.

1999-03-23  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	* smproxy.c (ProxySaveYourselfPhase2CB): Set the "_GSM_Priority" to 0,
	set SmRestartImmediately and define a SmCloneCommand [ D'oh! ].
	(main.c): ensure at most one copy runs on each display.
	(ProxySaveYourself, ProxyDie, HandleCreate): Only wait for proxy
	clients to die when shutting down and cancel shutdowns properly.

1999-03-10  robbe@orcus.priv.at

1999-01-23  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	* smproxy.c (ProxySaveYourselfPhase2CB, main): Changed command 
	line options to match rest of gnome (with temporary fallback).
	* save.c (WriteProxyFile): give the file a clearer name.
	
1999-01-16  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	* smproxy.c (HandleUpdate): protect against clients that
	delete the WM_COMMAND property (e.g. mozilla )
	
1998-12-09  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	* smproxy.c (ProxySaveYourselfPhase2CB): Changed SmDiscardCommand 
	to a SmLISTofARRAY8 so that it works with gnome-session
	
1998-10-22  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* save.c (WriteProxyFile): Use gnome_util_home_file to pick a file
	name in .gnome.

1998-10-08  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	SMPROXY_DEFS.
	* save.c: Assume HAS_MKSTEMP everywhere.

1998-07-18  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>
