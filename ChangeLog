	* gnome-session/app.[ch] 
	(gsm_app_class_init): added new GsmApp signals "registered" and "exited".
	(launch, app_exited): if case the application belongs to
	Initialization phase, monitor program exit in order to emit "exited"
	signal accordingly. 
	(gsm_app_registered): new method for emitting "registered" signal on
	an GsmApp object.

	* gnome-session/gconf.c (unset_display_setup): do not unset DISPLAY
	environment variable as gconf-sanity-check doesn't run if there's no
	defined display.

	* egg/eggsmclient.c (sm_client_post_parse_func): try to get session
	client id from the DESKTOP_AUTOSTART_ID environment variable in case
	no client id is given from command line option --sm-client-id. Unset
	this environment variable just after using it in order to avoid child
	processes to use the same client id.
