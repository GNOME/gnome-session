	compatibitility.

2008-04-10  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	Re-implemented the way we define the default session. Instead of a
	directory full of .desktop files, we now get the list of default apps
	from a gconf key. Then session manager then looks for those apps in

	require default apps to export their .desktop files in a special
	directory. #525157, Rob Bradford.

	all autostart and applications directories respectively.

	in order to make invalid memory accesses on wrong variable.

2007-10-27  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	* gnome-session/client.c (gsm_client_get_client_id,
	gsm_client_get_pid, gsm_client_get_desktop_file,
	gsm_client_get_restart_command, gsm_client_get_discard_command,
	gsm_client_get_autorestart, gsm_client_save_state): add definition for
	abstract methods in GsmClient.

2007-10-23  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	* gnome-session/gconf.c (unset_display_setup): revert change for
	unsetting DISPLAY environment variable before running
	gconf-sanity-check as now it can run without a display.

2007-10-21  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	* gnome-session/session.c 
	(start_phase): correctly check if application was successfully
	launched. Fix crasher when printing out error message in case application 
	failed to launch and returned no error.
	(gsm_session_register_client): emit "registered" signal on application
	with the registered session client id.

2007-10-21  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	* gnome-session/app.[ch] 
	(gsm_app_class_init): added new GsmApp signals "registered" and "exited".
	(launch, app_exited): if case the application belongs to
	Initialization phase, monitor program exit in order to emit "exited"
	signal accordingly. 
	(gsm_app_registered): new method for emitting "registered" signal on
	an GsmApp object.

2007-10-21  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	* gnome-session/gconf.c (unset_display_setup): do not unset DISPLAY
	environment variable as gconf-sanity-check doesn't run if there's no
	defined display.

2007-10-21  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	* egg/eggsmclient.c (sm_client_post_parse_func): try to get session
	client id from the DESKTOP_AUTOSTART_ID environment variable in case
	no client id is given from command line option --sm-client-id. Unset
	this environment variable just after using it in order to avoid child
	processes to use the same client id.

2007-10-21  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	* egg/eggdesktopfile.c (egg_desktop_file_launchv): fix leak and
	invalid memory access on environment variables array.

2007-10-21  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	* compat/gnome-keyring-daemon-wrapper.desktop.in,
	compat/gnome-settings-daemon-helper.desktop.in,
	data/gnome-panel.desktop, data/gnome-settings-daemon.desktop,
	data/metacity.desktop, data/nautilus.desktop,
	splash/gnome-login-sound.desktop.in,
	splash/gnome-session-splash.desktop.in: use 
	X-GNOME-Autostart-Notify key for passing session client ids
	through the DESKTOP_AUTOSTART_ID environment variable.
