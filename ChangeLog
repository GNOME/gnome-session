	style accordingly through the session client API (GnomeClient's 
	gnome_client_set_restart_style()).

	* gnome-session/client-xsmp.c 
	(register_client_callback): do not generate new IDs itself, and have it just pass 
	the previous_id directly to gsm_session_register_client(), and if it's NULL, then
	gsm_session_register_client() can generate the new client ID using
	gsm_xsmp_generate_client_id().

	* gnome-session/gconf.c (unset_display_setup): revert change for

	gconf-sanity-check as now it can run without a display.

2007-10-21  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

2007-10-21  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	* gnome-session/gconf.c (unset_display_setup): do not unset DISPLAY
	environment variable as gconf-sanity-check doesn't run if there's no
	defined display.

	* egg/eggsmclient.c (sm_client_post_parse_func): try to get session
	client id from the DESKTOP_AUTOSTART_ID environment variable in case
	no client id is given from command line option --sm-client-id. Unset
	this environment variable just after using it in order to avoid child
	processes to use the same client id.

2007-10-21  Lucas Rocha  <lucasr@gnome.org>

	* egg/eggdesktopfile.c (egg_desktop_file_launchv): fix leak and
	invalid memory access on environment variables array.
