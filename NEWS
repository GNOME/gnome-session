============
Version 49.0
============

- Translation updates
- Fixed build with musl libc
- Fixed some memory corruption bugs that led to gnome-session-init-worker
  crashing on logout
- Fixed a memory leak in gnome-session-init-worker
- Allowed Qt apps to use the Wayland text-input protocol, instead of forcing
  them to use the direct ibus integration plugin

=============
Version 49.rc
=============

- Disabled the org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver proxy service on the login screen
- Separated out the systemd-specific code from the gnome-session leader process
  into a dedicated executable. This makes it easier to integrate distributions
  that use alternative init systems with gnome-session (though note that this
  is still a usecase we don't officially support upstream)
- Translation updates

===============
Version 49.beta
===============

- gnome-session is no longer started via a shell script, and instead all of
  the necessary setup is done in C.
- gnome-session's builtin service manager has been completely removed. Service
  management will now be handled entirely by the operating system's native
  service manager (i.e. systemd). See the following blog post for more information:
  https://blogs.gnome.org/adrianvovk/2025/06/10/gnome-systemd-dependencies
- The "fail whale" dialog has been removed
- Various unused APIs and interfaces were removed, including:
	- The org.gnome.SessionManager.Client and o.g.SM.App D-Bus interfaces
	- Various D-Bus APIs related to the service manager
	- Various .desktop and .session file keys that were used only by the
	  builtin service manager
	- Fallback sessions, since there's no way to fall back anymore
- The code was significantly refactored
- gnome-session now provides a gnome-session-basic-services.target, that sessions
  like the GDM greeter and gnome-initial-setup can use to avoid listing all of
  the basic GNOME session services (like all the gnome-settings-daemon plugins)
- The --autostart command line option was removed, and instead kiosk sessions
  should set Kiosk=true in their session definition file.
- Updated GNOME's mimetype defaults to drop Evince (which was replaced with Papers)
- Translation updates

	* Add support to manage the session using the systemd user instance.
	  A new systemd_session build time option is added to enable/disable

	  Right now the support is enabled by default. Distributions should
	  be careful to ensure that other components are updated at the same
	  time (gnome-settings-daemon, gnome-shell, gdm) as subtle errors
	  may occur otherwise.
	  If in doubt, only enable the feature and test it by modifying the
	  gnome-session launch script to pass --systemd to
	  gnome-session-binary.

==============
Version 2.91.4
==============

Note to distributors:
 - the definition of the session started by gnome-session moved out of gconf
   and is now living in .desktop-like files. The format of those files might
   change in the future.
 - two predefined sessions are shipped: GNOME (default), that will start GNOME
   Shell, and Classic GNOME, that will start gnome-panel, metacity, etc. like in
   GNOME 2.
 - a small utility, gnome-session-is-accelerated, is used to determine if GNOME
   Shell can be used. If this is not the case, Classic GNOME will be used.
   Please send feedback on when this utility doesn't detect things properly.
 - it is known that session saving doesn't work well with people moving from
   one session to another at the moment. It can result in gnome-panel running
   with GNOME Shell, for example.

- Add autostart condition through GSettings (Bastien Nocera)

=================
Version 2.26.0.90
=================

Note: while this is a tarball from a stable branch, this version should be
considered as a test tarball. It contains some important changes to the session
manager to fix various issues, and we want those changes to be tested before
2.26.1.

Depending on how D-Bus and ConsoleKit are configured on your system, you might
need the patch from https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20471 for your
ConsoleKit configuration. This is required so it's possible for applications to
be able to know if there are more than one user logged in on the machine.

The two main fixes for this release are:
 - gnome-session now lets applications properly exit on logout
 - saving a session on logout is activated again

- Update man pages (Vincent)
- Let all processes exit cleanly on logout/reboot/shutdown (Vincent)
- Use smaller icon size in inhibit dialog (Vincent)
- Fix various crashes in inhibit dialog and during the logout process (Vincent)
- Make the inhibit dialog look at desktop files from autostart directories too
  (Vincent)
- Use XDG_CONFIG_HOME to save the session and create the session directory with
  the right permissions (Vincent)
- Get the discard command from XSMP clients and save it when saving a session,
  and use it when removing a saved session (Vincent)
- Properly handle XSMP clients that don't return a restart command when saving
  the session (Vincent)
- Various XSMP protocol fixes (Vincent)
- When saving the session, ask the XSMP clients to save the global and local
  states when needed instead of just asking them to save their global states.
  Else, clients won't appear on next login (Vincent)
- Allow XSMP clients to interact during the logout (and cancel the logout),
  using the inhibit infrastructure (Vincent)
- Allow clients to specify that they want to be ended last (Vincent)
- Hide deprecated command-line options from gnome-session-save --help (Vincent)
- Re-enable session saving (Vincent)
- Ignore XSyncAlarmDestroyed events, to avoid filling ~/.xsession-errors
  (Matthias Clasen)
- Various code cleanups (Vincent)

==============
Version 2.26.0

Note: this release disables session saving because it's not ready for wide
usage. It will hopefully be fixed for 2.26.1.

Versions Predating Git
======================

In GNOME 49, we removed various repo metadata files (such as ChangeLog)
that were used before the transition to Git. In case these files are
useful for some archaeological purpose, this note describes where to
find them. Commit 6427bf718585abd5459f052554bdb1e7363efa6c contains all
of these files in their final form.
