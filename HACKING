Hi,

As we are getting very close to the 1.4.1 release, I'd like people not to
commit to gnome-core or gnome-applets without first getting approval from
one of the maintainers of this module.  Translators and doc people are exempted
from this, of course.  I will update the HACKING files accordingly.

This hopefully won't last long as our list of things to before 1.4.1 is
getting shorter these days.

Thanks,
Kjartan Maraas
