This directory contains three small programs used at startup or
shutdown to do some user-notificationy things that used to be handled
directly by gnome-session.

  * gnome-session-splash: This provides the splash screen. It is
    mostly a straight port of the old gnome-session splash screen, but
    modified to get its data from Startup Notification rather than
    having gnome-session directly provide it with binary names, and
    then looking those binary names up in a hardcoded list in hopes of
    finding localized names and icons.

    At the moment, there is no way for gnome-session to tell the
    splash screen to go away. My original plan was for it to just use
    Startup Notification again, and send a "remove: ID=splash" message
    when it wanted the splash to disappear. It turns out that this
    doesn't work though, because libstartup-notification filters out
    the remove: message if it never saw a corresponding new: message.
    I haven't yet gotten around to coming up with Plan B. At any rate,
    it exits immediately if you click on it.

  * gnome-login-sound: This plays the login sound. If invoked with the
    "--logout" flag, it plays the logout sound instead.

  * gnome-logout-sound.sh: This gets installed into the session
    "shutdown" directory to run at logout time. It just invokes
    gnome-login-sound with the --logout flag.
