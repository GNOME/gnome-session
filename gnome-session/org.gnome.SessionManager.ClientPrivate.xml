  org.gnome.SessionManager.ClientPrivate:
  @short_description: Plumbing for D-Bus Clients

  This interface is used by
  <link linkend='gdbus-org.gnome.SessionManager.ClientPrivate'>clients</link>
  that connect to the Session Manager via D-Bus. It largely mirrors the
  functionality available in the X11 Session Manager Protocol.

      This should be called by the client in response to the
      #org.gnome.SessionManager.ClientPrivate::QueryEndSession and
      #org.gnome.SessionManager.ClientPrivate::EndSession signals.

      When @is_ok is false, the provided reason may be displayed to the user.
      The user may choose to ignore the reason, and continue with session
      shutdown anyways.

      QueryEndSession:
      @flags: Flags

      This signal is used to ask the client if it is ready for the session to
      end. The client must respond by calling
      #org.gnome.SessionManager.ClientPrivate.EndSessionResponse()
      within one second of the signal emission.

      The @flags may include:

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>
          <emphasis>1</emphasis>:
          Logout is forced. The client's inhibitors and the client's
          #org.gnome.SessionManager.ClientPrivate.EndSessionResponse()
          will be ignored.
        </para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      The client must not attempt to preform any actions or interact with the
      user in response to this signal. Any actions required for a clean shutdown
      must take place in response to the
      #org.gnome.SessionManager.ClientPrivate::EndSession signal.

    <!--
      EndSession:
      @flags: Flags

      This is the signal used to inform the client that the session is about to
      end. The client will be given ten seconds to perform any actions required
      for a clean shutdown. Once done, the client must respond by calling
      #org.gnome.SessionManager.ClientPrivate.EndSessionResponse()
      within the ten second period.

      The client must not attempt to interact with the user in response to this
      signal.
