2001-08-28  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* session-properties-capplet.c: Change help() to show_help()
	and make it use gnome_help_display() so it is shown in the default
	help-system.
	
2001-08-20  Jarkko Ranta <jjranta@cc.joensuu.fi>

	* *.desktop: Updated Finnish strings by Pauli Virtanen

Tue Aug 14 14:31:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* logout.c: apply a patch from Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
	  to make this work with some newer way redhat will be doing things

2001-08-03  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* *.desktop : Reviewed/Modified/Added traditional Chinese strings.

2001-08-03  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* *.desktop: Added nynorsk.
	
2001-07-12  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* logout.c (display_gui): s/Halt/Shut Down/

2001-06-19  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.COM>

	* gsm-client-list.c: (gsm_client_list_new):
	Changes from David KAELBLING <drk@sgi.com> to fix
	the build on IRIX [by way of Kjartan].

2001-04-18  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.COM>
	
	* save.c: Repeat what Richard did for main.c :)

2001-06-18  Richard Hult  <rhult@codefactory.se>

	* main.c: Add trailing NULL in g_strconcat call.

2001-06-15  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* main.c: (set_lang), (main)
	  save.c: (set_session_name)
	Fixed some sort of env var inconsistancy now uses g_
	equivalent. Started the first stage of multi-session
	panel implementation. We now have GNOME_SESSION_NAME
	env var for any app to use if need be.

2001-06-11  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	Removed some C duplicate variables - bug # 54780 from
	Dan McNichol. Just removed the extern ref's to the 
	ICE stuff from headers.h. Also renamed static variable
	in session-properties-capplet.c just to be pedantic :)

2001-06-11  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	Right I've had enough of this stinking 'warner' thing
	so I've removed about 99% of the references in it. Also
	cleaned up the default.session to remove the Warner and
	Chooser sessions - they are totally pointless now. This 
	also [quite by accident I assure you :)] fixes a bug
	#54843]  
	Removed stuff from the following -
	* command.c: (command)
	* default.in
	* headers.h
	* manager.c: (no_response_warning), (new_client)
	* session-properties-capplet.c: (main)
	* session-properties.c: (main)

2001-06-05  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* session-properties.desktop: Added Swedish translation.
	* session.desktop: Modified Swedish translation.

Thu May 31 00:43:59 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* splash.c: make dark half transparent rectangle behind the text as
	  the shadow, this makes the text completely readable even with a
	  light splashscreen.c (like we have now)

2001-05-30  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* headers.h: Added FAILSAFE_SESSION #def - mostly useless
	* main.c: (main): Removed setting of CurrentSession - the 
	  hack that was put in for gdm which killed the concept of 
	  multiple concurrent sessions. If in failsafe mode, make 
	  sure we just load Default from default.session only...even
	  if the session is called Failsafe for now - in theory we
	  should have a Failsafe session in default.session but for
	  the moment Default will do.
	* save.c: (read_session): Make sure we load Failsafe [ie.
	  Default] from default.session only...

	* gsm/*.[ch] - Man, this stuff is confusing...

2001-05-27  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

	* save-session.desktop, session-properties.desktop: Added
	comment; these desktops are used also in apps directory, so
	they should have comment (if item is dragged to panel, it's
	only text description).

2001-05-23  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* splash.c: make nautilus use desktop icon

Thu May 10 19:06:12 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* logout.c: include ice.h

	* manager.c, save.c, prop.c: In trying to procrastinate from doing
	  homework I sanitized the property code a little bit and fixed
	  a corner case minor leak.  Basically now the functions for
	  getting properties 1) have some preconditions 2) always set
	  the pointers when returning through an argument list (to NULL or 0)
	  to avoid possible uses of some uninitialized memory.  Also
	  fixed one 64bitness issue by casting pid_t to long in printf

2001-05-11  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>
	* command.c ice.c logout.c manager.c manager.h save.c: Apply patch
	  from Alan Cox. If this works [ie. fixes the enormous amount of 
          bugs against gsm] he will have saved the day once more, if it 
	  doesn't it probably will have done more good than harm. We can 
	  now freeze and thaw ICE while doing some gtk iterations so 
	  hopefully ICE won't stomp on other things.....
	  [Apparently].

2001-05-01  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>
	* session-names.c: Removed an unused variable that might just
          have caused an ugly segv

Wed May 02 16:38:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* splash.c, Makefile.am, gnome-splash-1.4.0.png: Add code to pick a
	  splash screen according to the version with the old
	  gnome-splash.png as a fallback.  So this new 1.4 splashscreen will
	  only show up in 1.4.0.x releases.  Just in case we forget to change
	  it.  Also add a black shadow to the text on the splashscreen to make
	  it nicer.

2001-05-01  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>
	* save.c: Get rid of stupid warning 

Sun Apr 29 23:46:44 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* main.c: when GDM_GNOME_SESSION is set, use that session.  Command
	  line still overrides it however

2001-04-30  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>
	* main.c: If using the --choose-session=ARG bit, then
	  immediately set the value of the CurrentSession. This
	  is mainly an untested fix for gdm

2001-04-26  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* default.in: So now we have [Classic] and [Default].
	  Classic will be gmc and Default will be Nautilus.
          Okay there's also [Nautilus] for some monkeys which 
          will be removed later.

2001-03-23  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>
	* logout.c: Get rid of gsm-protocol calls since they are not 
	  needed.

Wed Mar 14 12:39:26 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* logout.c:  call poweroff and reboot instead of shutdown, that works
	  on old and new redhats alike

Mon Mar 12 14:44:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* splash.c: Make it possible to make the done string translated, by
	  translating the entire line for the "done", and making it a special
	  case.

Sat Mar 10 19:13:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* logout.c: freeing strings from under gettext is generally
	  considered bad :)

2001-03-07  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	The following contains some gruesome hacks to not get gnome-session
        saving all the time. Actually it does carry out the save
        proccess but only writes to the session file when it should. It
        seems that this is the quickest hack to get things working 
        correctly.

	* command.c: (command): Add command for new GsmSessionSaveMode
	* gsm-protocol.c: (gsm_protocol_set_sessionsave_mode): Added 
        new function to set up the session save. 
	* gsm-protocol.h: Added function header
	* headers.h: Added extern gboolean session_save
	* logout.c: (display_gui): toggle_button was being reverse 
        engineered? [remove !]
	* main.c: Added gboolean session_save
	* manager.c: (save_yourself_request), (update_save_state),
	(new_client): So we save all the time - but do we write all
        the time?
	* save-session.c: (main): Now sets the value of session_save
        at the start of the save to TRUE and sets it back to false at
        the end of the save. This is just a klunky way of making sure 
        that the session gets saved.
	* save.c: (set_sessionsave_mode): Added new function. Sets the 
        session_save variable
	* save.h: Added function header
	* session.h: Added GsmSessionSaveMode hash-define.

2001-02-26  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* command.c: (command): Make sure that call with 
	  GsmAutoSaveMode is doing the right thing
	* save.c: (set_autosave_mode): Added function to set
          autosave variable [somehow got removed previously]
	* save.h: function definition
	* session-properties-capplet.c: (write_state): Don't
          use gnome_config to set autosave since it is set by
          the protocol.

Sat Feb 17 21:04:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* logout.c:  instead of simply checking for existance of
	  /usr/bin/shutdown, check for it being executable for the
	  current user.

2001-02-15  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* save.c (read_session): still look in user dir if session is
	`Default'

2001-02-15  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* default.in: add a `Nautilus' session.  In beta 2, `Classic' will
	run gmc, `Default' will run nautilus.
	
2001-02-14  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* save.c (read_session): if we are choosing a session, also look
	in the default file for it.

	* session-properties-capplet.c (capplet_build): default to the
	default session

2001-02-14 Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@ireland.sun.com>
	
	* session-properties-capplet.c/session-names.c: Was freeing 
          something I shouldn't, so 'try' and 'revert' *should* work 
	  like you think they should work, only different :)
	* session-properties-capplet.h: Added mindless whitespace hacking
	* command.c: Added mindless comment

2001-02-14  Christophe Merlet  <redfox@eikonex.org>

	* session-properties.c: Marqued string for translation.

Tue Feb 13 23:41:58 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* splash.c: use the windowmanager icon for sawfish, not sawfish.png,
	  until there is a nice sawfish icon

Tue Feb 13 21:57:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* session-properties-capplet.c:  Save splash setting under the correct
	  key

	* splash.c: splash bugfixing galore.  Add nautilus to list of
	  programs we know.  Fix possible crashes related to bad timeout
	  removal.  Don't run icon_cb if not needed.  Fix possible races
	  on destruction.  Make sure the scalefactor is in a reasonable level
	  so we don't crash on rediculous splash screen images.  Rescale
	  icons when they go out of bounds.  Use "fontset" and not "font"
	  for text, and mark fontname for translation.  Should fix any
	  remaining "splash screen segfaults" bugs on bugzilla.

Fri Feb 9 2001 Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>
	* save.c (set_session_name): Set the current session
	* gsm-protocol.c (gsm_protocol_set_session_name): Check *name
	  for non-NULL
	* session-properties-capplet.c (write_state): Remove config
	  code to set CurrentSession in ~/.gnome/session-options since
	  code in set_session_name (above) does this

Thurs Feb 8 2001 Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>
	* session-properties-capplet.c (capplet_build): Just fixed up a 
	  few Gtk-CRITICAL Warnings for the capplet code.

2001-01-28  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* manager.c (interact_done): if the shutdown is cancelled, send
	SmsShutdownCancelled message to clients in the
	save_finished_list as well as those in the save_yourself_list
	and the save_yourself_p2_list (otherwise these clients will
	hang waiting for this or SaveComplete)

Mon Feb 5 2001 Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>
	
	* Some gsm loving - just a quick cleanup, added headers 
		* headers.h, logout.h, save.h, ice.h, prop.h
 		  remote.h, command.h	
          Created single global variable gchar *session_name to 
          point to the current session, which can be changed by
          using gsm-protocol.

	* Implemented basic multi-session support. gnome-session
	  now supports --choose-session=ARG commandline option which
          will override any value for the CurrentSession key. If ARG
          doesn't exist in the session file, or if the value of the 
          CurrentSession doesn't exist in the session file, then 
          gnome-session will use the default but save to the given 
          session name.

	* Moved Current Session indicator to ~/.gnome/session-options
          file, along with new key/value pair AutoSave [which was more
	  intuitive that TrashMode

	* Incoporated capplet code into gnome-core/gsm and implemented
	  multi-session chooser [still buggy - doesn't do the try and
	  revert buttons properly, doesn't change the global session 
          pointer using the gsm_protocol]
		* session-properties-capplet.c, session-properties-capplet.h,
		  session-properties.desktop, startup-programs.c,
		  session-names.c

	* Updated the man page, changed session-properties.desktop file
           


Wed Jan 10 11:08:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	Applying the patches from helix rpms, redhat stuff and other
	fixes.

	* Makefile.am: compile with gdkpixmap canvas stuff

	* gnome-login-check.c: warning fix

	* main.c: apply the GDM_LANG patch from redhat stuff

	* splash.c: Use the helix version, but use the normal gnome
	  splash screen.  Fixup warnings, handle all error case, fix
	  a segfault and scale stuff correctly to the size of the
	  splashscreen image so that it works with any size splashscreen
	  image nicely and some i18n fixes

Mon Dec 18 00:10:13 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* logout.c:  Just before showing the dialog, focus the default widget
	  otherwise Help might actually end up getting the default because
	  it might end up getting the focus.

Wed Dec 13 20:50:16 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-login-check.c, ice.c, manager.[ch], prop.c, remote.c, 
	  save.c:  Fixup malloc/g_malloc confusion a bit.  Use glib's
	  mem routines in more places where possible.  Also add a bunch
	  of sanity "null after free" things all around, and use
	  g_snprintf instead of sprintf out of paranoia (none of those
	  actually resulted in real fixes though).  So this is not a high
	  priority fix and doesn't need to go to stable, it just makes it
	  all work with glib's mem checking stuff turned on.

2000-11-15  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gnome-login-check.c (main): change the error message to
	reference the patch which fixes this.

2000-11-09  Karl Eichwalder  <ke@suse.de>

	* gnome-wm: Fix typo.

2000-11-03  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gnome-login-check.c (main): only do the login check on Solaris

Thu Nov 02 01:58:03 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* manager.c (update_save_state):  When concatenating, copy the
	  list.  Also free the old list since we used a copy to concat.
	  this is because the send_message is mucking around inside the
	  list which really confuses things unless it works on it's own
	  private copy.  This pases with glib compiled with glists really
	  being freed.

2000-10-31  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gnome-login-check.c (main): patch from KUSANO Takayuki
	<AE5T-KSN@asahi-net.or.jp> to fix i18n

2000-10-30  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gnome-libice-check.c (main): seg fault if libICE is broken

	* gnome-login-check.c (main): add a test for broken libICE on solaris

2000-10-15 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* updated help/C/session.sgml for Nautilus compatibility (patch
	from Greg Leblanc)

Thu Jun 29 02:39:04 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* main.c (main): if the session loaded is empty (probably because
	the session name is a new one), fallback to failsafe and reload,
	so the clients of the default session are present.

Sat May 27 12:33:19 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* main.c, manager.c, session-properties.c, gsm-protocol.c, ice.c:
          Fix compile warnings

	* logout.c: Dialog running can return -1 as well.  This is fixes
	  a compile warning and bug #12130

2000-05-18  Mark Crichton <crichton@gimp.org>

        * session-properties.c: Made it use a better default visual.
        This is for the proposed changes in gdk_imlib.

2000-05-14  Karl Eichwalder  <ke@suse.de>

	* session.desktop: Improve de.

2000-05-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@helixcode.com>

	* ice.c (initialize_ice): By default, do not listen to TCP
	connections.

Mon May 08 20:18:32 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* splash.c (destroy_dialog): run gnome-hint with --startup-session

2000-05-06  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* default.in: move gmc to priority 40 so that it shows up in the
	splash screen

2000-05-05  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* logout.c (display_gui): open up (the panel's) help
	(display_gui): add a help button

2000-05-03  Michael Meeks  <michael@helixcode.com>

	* command.c (command): s/strcasecmp/g_strcasecmp/

Tue May 02 23:42:25 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* ice.c: since the code using IceListenForWellKnownConnections is
	  comment it out, comment out the init_well_known_connections
	  function, this will make it at least for now compile on non
	  Linux or IRIX systems.

2000-05-03  Yukihiro Nakai <nakai@gnome.gr.jp>

	* save-session.desktop: Add Japanese translation.

2000-04-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* gnome-wm: updated for sawmill -> sawfish name change

2000-04-20  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* session-properties.c (help): May as well make the help button
	actually do something

2000-01-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* gnome-session.1: remove options that are not actually
	implemented (Thank to Owen for reviewing the documentation)

2000-04-15  Karl EICHWALDER  <ke@suse.de>

	* save-session.desktop: Add de, lt, ru and sv -- entries were gone
	with revision 1.14 (fi).

2000-04-14  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* session.desktop & save-session.desktop :
		added [tr] ...

2000-04-12  Karl EICHWALDER  <ke@suse.de>

	* save-session.desktop (Name): Add `de'.
	* session.desktop (Comment): Improve `de'.

2000-04-04  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* save-session.desktop (Icon): use mc's floppy icon

	* ice.c (initialize_ice): enable TCP for now, since the
	non-TCP is very broken here.

	* save-session.1: document --gui

2000-04-03  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* ice.c (init_well_known_connections): pass &socket, not socket

2000-04-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@helixcode.com>

	* ice.c (init_well_known_connections): Attempt to allocate a
	number of ports, instead of failing on the first one

2000-01-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* gnome-session.1: remove options that are not actually
	implemented (Thank to Owen for reviewing the documentation)

2000-03-31  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* ice.c (initialize_ice): 

	* main.c (main): we need to gnomelib_init() before
	initialize_ice() due to the fact that gnome-libs is
	broken, and we need to gnome_config() in initialize_ice()

2000-04-03  Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@computer.org>

	* gsm.desktop: Add Irish (Gaelic) translation.

2000-03-30  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	Peter Runestig <peter@runestig.com>)

2000-02-27  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* splash.c (window_realize): add some better window hints

	* default.in (num_clients): remove gnome-hint from the session

	* splash.c (stop_splash): add a 2 second delay after we get called
	before destroying the dialog.
	(stop_splash): run gnome-hint if splash screen is disabled
	(splash_cleanup): run gnome-hint if splash screen is enabled

2000-02-20  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (desktop_DATA): put in the Session directory

2000-02-18  Timur Bakeyev  <timur@gnu.org>

	* gnome-wm: Replace call to 'which' with simple, home-made script.
	Unfortunately, some vendors are broken-mind, and which returns 0 and
	error string on stdout instead of just indication of an error...
	
	* Add qvwm as a bit better WM that fvwm:.

2000-02-13  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	initialized signal
	(initialized_cb): disable this code for now
	(main): show the app here

2000-01-11  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* splash.c (start_splash): Changed the splash window to a

	* save-session.1: New man page.

1999-12-10  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* *.c: Eliminate miscellaneous warnings found by OSPC, including the bugfix for property name comparison.

	* logout.c (display_gui): Call set_trash_mode.
	(save): Removed.

	* logout.c: Reverted previous patch.  It turns out that saves can

	confusion and not much more.

1999-08-01  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* logout.c (display_gui): always display the "save current setup"
	check box, but uncheck it if we are trashing the session

	* manager.c (reincarnate_client): Account for the
	fact that a client that has not yet had a handle
	assigned to it may be restarted if it dies during
	initialization. (Fixes problem where control-C'ing
	gmc while it was waiting for the metadata lock

	Split some common code off into a separate function. 

1999-07-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

1999-05-22  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com> 

	* ice.c (initialize_ice): incorporate Martin's change of 1999-05-20

	* ice.c (startup_clean_ice): New static function. After an unclean

	remove first.

	* session.desktop: Added [de] translations; methinks this was a

1999-03-23  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* gnome-wm: New file. This is a short shell script that starts
	the WM for us. The user can set a WINDOW_MANAGER environment
	variable in his ~/.xsession to set his prefered WM; otherwise
	it looks which WMs are installed and chooses a good one. To tell
	the wm-properties-capplet which WM we're running, this will be
	writtin into `default_wm/Default/WM'.

	* Makefile.am: Added explicit dependency to create default.session

	(purge_client): put GsmAddClient clients into purge_retain_list.
	* ice.c (initialize_ice): do not free value passed to putenv.

	* Makefile.am (default_DATA): Install default.session

1999-02-14  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* manager.c (close_connection): Removed C++ comment.

1999-02-14 Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	* manager.c (io_error_handler): NEVER close connections outside

1999-02-14 Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	in the pending_list.

	as the gtk_main_loop does this now inside gnome-ice.c.
	* save-session.c (main): wait until request is acknowledged before
	dying because gnome-session no longer honours requests from zombies.
	
1999-01-21  Carsten Schaar  <nhadcasc@fs-maphy.uni-hannover.de>

	* ice.c (initialize_ice): Removed the 'free' call to the argument
 	of 'putenv', because this breaks the setting of the environment
