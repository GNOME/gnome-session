Mon Dec 18 00:10:13 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* logout.c:  Just before showing the dialog, focus the default widget
	  otherwise Help might actually end up getting the default because
	  it might end up getting the focus.

Wed Dec 13 20:50:16 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-login-check.c, ice.c, manager.[ch], prop.c, remote.c, 
	  save.c:  Fixup malloc/g_malloc confusion a bit.  Use glib's
	  mem routines in more places where possible.  Also add a bunch
	  of sanity "null after free" things all around, and use
	  g_snprintf instead of sprintf out of paranoia (none of those
	  actually resulted in real fixes though).  So this is not a high
	  priority fix and doesn't need to go to stable, it just makes it
	  all work with glib's mem checking stuff turned on.

2000-11-15  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gnome-login-check.c (main): change the error message to
	reference the patch which fixes this.

	* gnome-login-check.c (main): only do the login check on Solaris

Thu Nov 02 01:58:03 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* manager.c (update_save_state):  When concatenating, copy the
	  list.  Also free the old list since we used a copy to concat.
	  this is because the send_message is mucking around inside the
	  list which really confuses things unless it works on it's own
	  private copy.  This pases with glib compiled with glists really
	  being freed.

2000-10-31  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gnome-login-check.c (main): patch from KUSANO Takayuki

	from Greg Leblanc)

Thu Jun 29 02:39:04 2000  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* main.c (main): if the session loaded is empty (probably because
	the session name is a new one), fallback to failsafe and reload,
	so the clients of the default session are present.

Sat May 27 12:33:19 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* main.c, manager.c, session-properties.c, gsm-protocol.c, ice.c:

	* command.c (command): s/strcasecmp/g_strcasecmp/

Tue May 02 23:42:25 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* ice.c: since the code using IceListenForWellKnownConnections is
	  comment it out, comment out the init_well_known_connections
	  function, this will make it at least for now compile on non
	  Linux or IRIX systems.

2000-05-03  Yukihiro Nakai <nakai@gnome.gr.jp>

	* save-session.desktop: Add Japanese translation.

2000-04-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	implemented (Thank to Owen for reviewing the documentation)

2000-03-31  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* ice.c (initialize_ice): 

	* main.c (main): we need to gnomelib_init() before
	initialize_ice() due to the fact that gnome-libs is
	broken, and we need to gnome_config() in initialize_ice()

2000-04-03  Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@computer.org>

	GTK_WINDOW_POPUP one and put everything in a GtkFrame.

Mon Jan 10 17:26:50 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnome-wm: Take two arguments, --default-wm and --sm-client-id
	  and run a windowmanager with the client id translated into an

	* splash.c: put the splashscreen into the WIN_LAYER_ABOVEDOCK
	  layer to put it above anything.  Makes it look much better
	  if the splashscreen stays around long enough for the hints
	  to come up.

2000-01-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@gnu.org>

	* save-session.1: New man page.

	to level 49

1999-12-10  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* default.in: don't pass -clientId as this really screws
	things up for people using sawmill or wmaker.  We should
	probably find a better way of doing this

	* *.c: Eliminate miscellaneous warnings found by OSPC, including the bugfix for property name comparison.
	* gnome-login-check.c: Check ownership of /tmp/orbit-username for sanity's sake.

1999-10-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* logout.c, manager.c, gnome-login-check.c: Include config.h.
	Otherwise messages are not translated.

1999-10-22  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gnome-wm: add sawmill to the front of the list,
	since people who have sawmill probably want to use it

1999-10-21  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* manager.h: use a signed int for num_sockets.

1999-10-20  Martin Norbäck  <norpan@bigfoot.com>

	for a window manager

	<Myth> twm is better than nothing at all	

1999-08-01  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* logout.c (display_gui): Call set_trash_mode.
	(save): Removed.

	* logout.c: Reverted previous patch.  It turns out that saves can
	happen at "random" times, so this change would have caused user
	confusion and not much more.

1999-08-01  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* logout.c (display_gui): always display the "save current setup"
	check box, but uncheck it if we are trashing the session

	* gsm-client-editor.c (gsm_client_editor_class_init): Removed
	unused variable.
	(gsm_client_editor_new): Likewise.
	* gsm-client-list.c (gsm_client_list_class_init): Removed unused
	variable.
	(gsm_client_list_new): Likewise.

Wed Jun 16 09:28:48 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* manager.c (reincarnate_client): Account for the
	fact that a client that has not yet had a handle
	assigned to it may be restarted if it dies during
	initialization. (Fixes problem where control-C'ing
	gmc while it was waiting for the metadata lock
	would kill gnome-session)

	Split some common code off into a separate function. 

1999-07-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* ice.c (initialize_ice): Save umask while calling
	IceListenForConnections.  From Roberto Zunino
	<zunino@cli.di.unipi.it>.

	* auth.h: Removed.
	* auth.c: Removed.

1999-07-05  David Kaelbling <drk@sgi.com>

	* manager.c: time_t is not always a long as it was assumed.  ON
	64-mahcines it might be sometehing else.

1999-05-22  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com> 

	* ice.c (initialize_ice): incorporate Martin's change of 1999-05-20
	into initialize_ice so that gsm only locks the authority file once.
	(startup_clean_ice): redundant and removed.
	
1999-05-20  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* ice.c (startup_clean_ice): New static function. After an unclean
	shutdown clean_ice () may not have been called the last time so there
	may be stale records left in the ICEauthority file which we need to
	remove first.

1999-04-14  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* session.desktop: Added [de] translations; methinks this was a
	silly thing since the file looked kinda obsolete...

1999-03-25  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am: Put gnome-wm in EXTRA_DIST.

1999-03-24  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	default.session into the purge_retain_list so they are restarted.
	
1999-03-23  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* gnome-wm: New file. This is a short shell script that starts
	the WM for us. The user can set a WINDOW_MANAGER environment
	variable in his ~/.xsession to set his prefered WM; otherwise
	it looks which WMs are installed and chooses a good one. To tell
	the wm-properties-capplet which WM we're running, this will be
	writtin into `default_wm/Default/WM'.

	* Makefile.am: Added explicit dependency to create default.session
	and default.wm if config.status has changed.

1999-03-22  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com> 

	* manager.c (no_response_warning): remove clients on failure to

	* gsm-protocol.c, gsm-protocol.h: obtain user confirmations.

1999-03-19  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com> 

	* main.c (main): extra command line options.
	* save.c (set_session_name): set name to TRASH_SESSION on trash-saves.

	* default.in: add specification of the chooser command/session.
	* gsm-client-*: signal end of session startup. 
	
1999-03-18  Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com> 

	* save.c (read_one_client): never use glib to alloc client->id. 
	* manager.c (free_client): use free to free client->id because libSM
	allocs client->id using malloc.
	(remove_client): also remove clients which have yet to be started.
	(purge_client): put GsmAddClient clients into purge_retain_list.
	* ice.c (initialize_ice): do not free value passed to putenv.
	* Makefile.am: change files used in build as follows...
	* gsm-column.*: no longer used.
	* gsm-client-editor.*: alternative means of editing clients.
	* gsm-*: change GUI details and add session chooser stuff.
	* session-properties.c: updated for changs in GUI.

1999-03-17  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* manager.c (free_client): use g_free() to free client->id instead
	of free(). It is a value returned by gnome_config_get_string().

Wed Mar 17 11:48:11 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am (default_DATA): Install default.session
	in $datadir/gnome, where it is being looked for now.
	
1999-03-12 Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com> 

	* session.h: protocol extension specs.
	* command.c: contains the code implementing the server side of
	the gnome-session protocol extensions.
	* manager.*, save.c.: accomodate protocol extensions.
	* ice.c: remove dependency on iceauth binary.
	* main.c: fix SIGPIPE handling.
	* gsm-client-*, gsm-column.*: the client list widget code.
	* gsm-protocol.*: gtk interface to protocol extensions.
	* session-properties.c: use client list widget.
	* Makefile.am: build the new code.

1999-03-02  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* default.wm.in: New file. We install this in $(datadir) and
	read it in the wm-properties capplet to get the default WM.

1999-02-25 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am: moved to Settings group

1999-02-16 Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	* manager.h: move DEFAULT_SESSION to session.h
	* session.h: add the additional info needed by session-properties.
	These changes allow the session-properties capplet to control which
	non-session aware clients are in the session by editing the config.
	* session-properties.c: fixed but rendered obsolete by capplet.
	
1999-02-14  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* manager.c (close_connection): Removed C++ comment.

1999-02-14 Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	* manager.c (io_error_handler): NEVER close connections outside
	gnome-ice.c because the ICElibs sometimes go haywire if you close 
	a connection inside the IceProcessMessages call!
	(kill_client_connection): redundant and removed.
	
1999-02-14 Felix Bellaby  <felix@pooh.u-net.com>
