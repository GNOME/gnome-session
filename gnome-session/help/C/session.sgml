    <title>Session Properties</title>
    <para>
      <systemitem>Session Properties</systemitem> monitors the 
      state of current GNOME running applications and capplets, as seen in
      <link linkend="session-properties-screenshot">Figure 1</link>.  <systemitem>
      Session Properties</systemitem> displays a list of all the 
      applications and capplets currently running, what will happen to 
      the program if you logout, and the state of the application.  It allows 
      you to change the style and priority of each program.  You 
      can shut down applications, if you wish, and those applications 
      will be removed from your GNOME session.  You can also use 
      <systemitem>Session Properties</systemitem> to kill a GNOME 
      application and remove it from <systemitem>session management
      </systemitem> so it will not be restarted when you log in next 
      time.  Of course, there are other ways to kill an 
      application, such as using an explicit kill command, but they 
      would not prevent an application from being restarted if it has 
      the <link linkend="session-properties-respawn"><guilabel>Respawn 
      Style</guilabel></link>.  The only way to permanently remove such 
      an application is with the <link linkend="session-properties-remove">
      <guibutton>Remove</guibutton></link> button.

	Applications that are not 100 percent GNOME compliant are not managed

      <title>Priority Order</title>
      <para>
	The <guilabel>priority order</guilabel> sets the order the applications 
	will start in the GNOME <link linkend="session-properties-screenshot">
	<systemitem>Session Manager</systemitem></link>.  This lets applications be started 
	after other applications or capplets they are dependent upon.  
	If an application needs to start before the <systemitem>window manager
	</systemitem>, like a server, you can change the <guilabel>order</guilabel>
	number to be lower than the <systemitem>window manager's</systemitem>
	<guilabel>order</guilabel> number.  Usually most applications will have 
	an order number of 50.  If the application or capplet is a part of the 
	<systemitem>window manager</systemitem> or critical system then it 
	should be assigned a lower <guilabel>order</guilabel> number.

      <para>
	The <guilabel>Style</guilabel> option sets the restart style of 
	each application running in the GNOME <link linkend="session-properties-screenshot">
	<systemitem>Session Manager</systemitem></link>.  When an application closes the <guilabel>style
	</guilabel> option controls what happens to the program.  The style most 
	applications run with is <guilabel>Normal</guilabel>.  There are currently 
	four styles of applications and capplets.

	    The vast majority of applications you run will have this style
