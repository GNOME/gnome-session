Bugzilla: 2766

bugs.gnome.org: 415, 1009, 1021

	415: Minicommander color settings are ignored. Haven't tried
	     the other items.

	1009: We should turn "Add main menu" item into an "Add menu"
	      submenu that lets people add
	      system/user/KDE/anotherlevel/normal/etc. menus onto
	      their panel.

	1021: Swallowing is STILL broken.

	1081: It's sort of hard to fix this one - it's basically a
	      result of blocking CORBA calls...

Remaining issues:
	gnome-terminal help pages need to be installed.
