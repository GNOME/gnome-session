.SH NAME
gnome-wm \- Launches the user selected window manager for the GNOME
session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B gnome-wm [--default-wm windowmanager] [--sm-client-id id]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIgnome-wm\fP script invokes the user selected window manager.
If the user has not chosen a window manager it will try to launch a
GNOME compliant window manager.
.PP
The user can overwrite the selection of a window manager by setting
the 
.B WINDOW_MANAGER
environment variable.  If a --default-wm option is given the script uses
that window manager in case
.B WINDOW_MANAGER
is not set.  If gnome-wm is given as the argument to --default-wm then it
is the same as if no default was given.
.PP
The script takes the --sm-client-id argument and translates the id to an
appropriate option depending on which window manager was selected.
.PP

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The \fIgnome-wm\fP program uses the value of the
.B WINDOW_MANAGER 
environment variable to let the user override the configured window
manager. 
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR gnome-session(1), default.session(5)
.SH BUGS
